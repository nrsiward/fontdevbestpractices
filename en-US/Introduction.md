This book has been produced to help make the process of type design available to anyone. Type design
is visually complex as well as highly technical &ndash; however it is easier to begin making type
now than ever, partly because of the availability of free tools like [FontForge]. While being a
handy tool with which to begin, FontForge is not just for beginners. It has an advanced toolset
and is rapidly improving at the time this book is being written.

This book aims to offer technical help and general insight into planning a type design project, and
also offers advice about how to make your workflow more efficient.

If you wish to help us, you can contribute to making FontForge better by giving feedback or even by
contributing content and fixes [on GitHub].  
If you face any bug in FontForge, search the [issue tracker] on GitHub to see if you hit a known bug
and what the state of its resolution is. Otherwise, see [here][bug] for bug reporting guidelines.

We hope you will enjoy reading this tutorial as much as we did writing it.
